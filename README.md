# Udemy JavaScript Projects

A repository for all the projects built alongside Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course [JavaScript - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/).

It should be noted that I did not complete this course in a linear way. Having prior vanilla JavaScript experience through FreeCodeCamp and work experience, I did not need to complete all the modules that were given in the course. Alongside this, I took a long break after completing the core modules to focus on the React course, also by Max. Once that was completed, I revisited this course to finish the bonus modules for completeness sake (and the certificate!)

Because of the above, this repo contains fewer projects than the React course. Another reason for this is a lot of the modules were presented in a 'playground' style, experimenting with JavaScript features on a blank document as opposed to building projects, like in the React course. The folders in this repo are named to describe what was taught in that particular module. A full list of all JavaScript features taught in this course is given below:
