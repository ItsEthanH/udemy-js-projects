# Udemy Javascript Projects
A repository of my projects from following Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Complete Javascript Guide

# Section 7: Working with the DOM
This is my first project following along Max's guide. This one uses the Document Object Model to capture information about a movie from the user, save it as an object within an array 'database', then render it using HTML and CSS. I was able to mostly do this on my own, only watching the video when I completed the task myself. I would like to later work on saving the database to the browser, so that the database can be saved between sessions.
